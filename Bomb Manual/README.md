This is a C++ program of the Bomb Manual for the video game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.  The developers of the game have released a manual for the game at this URL: http://www.bombmanual.com
Not every section of the manual has been implemented, either because I do not know how to code it or because it is simply too complicated to code at this point in time.  If you have any suggestions for how to implement those sections, let me know!
